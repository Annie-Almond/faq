# What is SheCodesOKC?
- SheCodesOKC is a network of female and non-binary technologists who come together each month to learn and support each other. We discuss topics ranging from coding, new libraries, hardware, professional development, and more. We empower women and non-binary individuals and provide outreach for those entering the technology field. We can't wait to meet you!
- Please review our [code of conduct](https://www.techlahoma.org/code-of-conduct/) before attending our events.

# Where can I find more info about SheCodesOKC?

# Is this group only for experienced users or can it be for anyone who hasn't done coding at all?
- This group is for every level of coding and anyone interested in coding technology.

# Why are your programs for women and non-binary members only?
- With only 27% of the coding roles in the United States currently held by women, and 75% of the fastest growing jobs requiring tech skills, we're passionate about bridging the gap for women by creating a community of supporters.
